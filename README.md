# <professional-portfolio>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a personal portfolio of works I've completed during my coding bootcamp and beyond. The goal would be to showcase my work to potential employers and others looking to learn from my deployed applications. In future variations of this project, I would like to add javascript functionality so adding future works is easier.
